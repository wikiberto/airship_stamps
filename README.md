Postal Stamps of Airships by Alberto Arana-Hidalgo

This site is devoted to compile all the world issued postal stamps on Airships.
Airship history started around 18xx and is not yet finished although the golden era of airships can be traced back to the years 1920-1940.
We will have three different classifications:
1. Country of issue of the staps (incl. date of issue and number of stams in the sheet or collection)
2. Model of Airship (incl. country of ship)
Other parameters will be a tick if I own the particular stamp
A reference page will show books on stamps collection and on airship history
